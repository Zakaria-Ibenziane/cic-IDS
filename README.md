## ⚛ CIC-FLOWMETER 

 CICFlowMeter is a network traffic flow generator available from here . It can be used to generate bidirectional flows, where the first packet determines the forward (source to destination) and backward (destination to source) directions, hence the statistical time-related features can be calculated separately in the forward and backward directions. Additional functionalities include, selecting features from the list of existing features, adding new features, and controlling the duration of flow timeout.
